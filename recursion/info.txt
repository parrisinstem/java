DEFINITION
Recursion has two fundamental aspects: the base case and recursive step.
Difference between iteration is we rely on a counting variable and boolean condition
Recursion calls the base case which determins whether the function will recurse or call 
Without a base case its is equivalent to and infinite loop
 

 A call stack tracks the funciton calls, computer will throw and error due to stack overflow if
 the base case is not sufficient 

In the recursive step the counting variable equivalent is the argument to the recursive callm

Its recursive because the problem is being describe in terms of itself

DISADVANTAGES

Iteration is more efficient
